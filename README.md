Hi, I’m @theittsco
- I’m interested in scientific data analysis and data processing using Python, C++, and bash shell. I love using statistics and machine learning 
to solve problems where appropriate and applying these concepts to quantitative financial problems too!  
- I’m currently learning the inner working of C++ and how to further incorporate it into my workflow.
- I’m looking to collaborate on statistical problems applied to physics and physics engines. Additionally I would love to contribute to machine learning 
repositories wherever I can!
