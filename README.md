Hi, I’m @theittsco, a physicist and signal processing enthusiast working on scientific instrumentation and computational modeling.
- I’m interested in scientific data analysis and data processing. I love using statistics and machine learning 
to solve problems where appropriate and applying these concepts to quantitative financial problems too!  
- I’m looking to collaborate on statistical problems applied to physics and physics engines. Additionally, I would love to contribute to machine learning 
repositories wherever I can!

- **Languages**: C++, Python, bash
- **Specialties**: Scientific computing, high throughput computing, DSP

# Physics

Ph.D. physicist, heavily involved in the Fermilab Muon g-2 and Mu2e experiments. 

## Fermilab Muon g-2
- Led a full physics analysis to calculate the muon’s anomalous spin precession frequency, contributing to the world’s most precise measurement to date
- Collaborated across three analysis subgroups (the ωₐ team, Slow-Term Task Force, and Beam Dynamics Task Force), managing systematics, developing custom multivariable fitting tools, and optimizing data workflows

## Fermilab Mu2e
- Contributed to the design, simulation, and commissioning of the Stopping Target Monitor (STM) detector, evaluating multiple geometries through magnetic simulations and helping reduce material costs by $120K
- Conducted quality control instrumentation tests on tracker panels—using high-voltage systems, radioactive sources, and Python-based analysis tools to identify electrical and structural defects
- Developed and deployed machine learning models to classify momentum tracks in the Mu2e tracker, improving signal-background discrimination and analysis accuracy
  
## CERN CMS
- Worked on the development and testing of next-generation high-granularity calorimeters for the CMS endcap upgrade at the Large Hadron Collider
- Characterized leakage currents in silicon sensors for the CMS endcap calorimeter, contributing to quality assurance of radiation-tolerant detector components
- Designed and implemented a custom Python-based data acquisition interface using PyQt5, PyVISA, and Keithley’s TSP scripting language
